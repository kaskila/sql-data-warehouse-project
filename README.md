# SQL Data Warehouse & Analytics Project 🚀

Welcome to my **Data Warehouse and Analytics Portfolio Project**!
This project showcases a complete end-to-end data engineering solution—from ingesting raw data to generating powerful, actionable business insights using industry-standard practices.

## 🌐 Project Objective

To design and implement a modern data warehouse solution using **SQL Server**, based on the **Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold)** model. The project aims to demonstrate skills in data modeling, ETL development, and analytics reporting.

## 🏗️ Data Architecture (Medallion Layers)

| Layer      | Description                                                                         |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Bronze** | Raw data ingested directly from ERP and CRM CSV files into SQL Server.              |
| **Silver** | Data cleaning, standardization, and transformation for consistency and reliability. |
| **Gold**   | Final star schema for reporting and analytics (fact and dimension tables).          |
